### Files Changed
- `src/components/explore/ExploreSplitView.tsx` — Full rewrite
- `src/components/explore/MapView.tsx` — Updated props and map bounds

### Summary
**Explore Page Redesign** — per user design reference (Navios-style map app)

**ExploreSplitView.tsx:**
- Replaced old single-select category filter with multi-select category chips
- New categories: Cafe, Temple, Restaurant, Park, Bar, Workshop, Museum, Local shop
- Each category has a unique color and lucide-react icon
- Added "Near Me" checkbox — uses browser Geolocation API, filters places within 3 km (Haversine formula)
- Removed left-panel list; map is now full-screen on both mobile and desktop
- Category chips overlaid on top of map
- Clicking a map pin shows a bottom slide-up Place Card
- Place Card shows: photo, category badge, name, hashtags, phone number, close button
- Mock data: 1 place per category with hashtags and phone numbers
- Responsive: chips scroll horizontally on mobile, wrap on desktop

**MapView.tsx:**
- Added `maxBounds` to restrict map to Phitsanulok city area ([16.78, 100.20] → [16.87, 100.33])
- Added `onSelectId` callback prop — fires when a marker is clicked, returns place id
- Markers now fire `onSelectId` on click instead of opening a Leaflet Popup
- Zoom controls hidden on mobile (unchanged)

## 2026-04-29 (session 3) — Branch: `P_branch1_Map`

### Files Changed
- `src/components/home/TopSpotsCarousel.tsx` — Card redesign + Explore page linking
- `src/app/[locale]/explore/page.tsx` — Added `searchParams` for `?place=` param
- `src/components/explore/ExploreSplitView.tsx` — Added `initialPlaceId` prop + auto-open logic

### Summary
**Home → Explore deep-link: Trending Local Spots cards now navigate to specific map pins**

**TopSpotsCarousel.tsx:**
- Replaced 5-card mock data with 4 real cards mapped to temple-001–004 (Explore PLACES IDs)
- Card 1: Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat → temple-001 (uses real Explore place image)
- Cards 2–4: วัดนางพญา, วัดจันทร์ตะวันตก, วัดจันทร์ตะวันออก → temple-002/003/004 (location: "xxx, xxx")
- Removed star rating and review count from all cards
- Removed 5th card (Phitsanulok Craft Workshop)
- Each card wrapped in `<Link href="/explore?place={exploreId}">` for same-tab navigation

**explore/page.tsx:**
- Added `searchParams: Promise<{ place?: string }>` to page props
- Reads `place` value and passes it as `initialPlaceId` to `<ExploreSplitView>`

**ExploreSplitView.tsx:**
- Added `initialPlaceId?: string` prop
- `useEffect` on mount: if `initialPlaceId` is set, finds the matching place and calls `setSelectedPlace` to auto-open its Place Card
- `visiblePlaces` override: when `initialPlaceId` is provided, shows only that single place on the map (ignores category filter and Near Me)
